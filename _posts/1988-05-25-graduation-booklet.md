<figcaption align="center"><p>
The Lady Hailsham Staff, presented to the University in
February 1982 by the Sir Robert Menzies Oration Committee,
is a memorial to Lady Hailsham, who died tragically in a
horse riding accident in Sydney two days before her
husband, Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone, delivered the
Inaugural Oration in the Great Hall of the University in
May 1978.</p>

<p>The staff was designed by Mr D Connelly MP and crafted
by V. Hemmingsen of Adelaide and P. Noakes of Sydney
It is surmounted by a Viscountess' coronet (a mark of Lady
Hailsham's rank) on top of a thistle of silver and a ball of
Connemara marble. All metals used are of gold and silver.
The coronet is studed with sapphires from Sri Lanka, where
Lady Hailsham spent part of her childhood.</p>

<p>The Connemara marble was donated by Lord Mayo and is
from the county in Ireland whence lady Hailsham's family
originated. The thistle symbolises the association with Sir
Robert Menzies. The staff is made of Tasmanian blackwood
with tip and joins in silver.</p>

<p>It is carried in procession by the Yeoman Bedell.</p></figcaption>

## The Great Hall

The Great Hall was designed by Edmund Thomas Blacket (1817-1883). In 1849 Blacket
was appointed Colonial Architect of New South Wales, but in 1854 he resigned and
returned to private practice to design and supervise new buildings for the University of
Sydney. Although he designed many buildings during his career (including St Paul's
College and St Andrew's Cathedral), the Great Hall, in the style of the Victorian Gothic
revival, represents one of his most spectacular achievements. It was first used for the
conferring of degrees on 18 July 1859.

The Hall measures 41 metres (135 feet) in length and 14 metres (45 feet) in breadth.
The side walls are nearly 14 metres (45 feet) in height and the apex of the open timbered
roof is 22 metres (70 feet) from the floor. The walls are local standstone, except that on
the Oriel window in the south side there are armorial bearings carved in Caen stone.
The same stone has been used for the Tudor fireplace and carved doorway into the Ante
Room. The floor of the hall is of Australian marble. The frame of the roof is made of
Australian hardwood faced with cedar, while all of the great beams and carvings are of
cedar from the northern rivers area of New South Wales.

The Hall is clearly modelled, although on a smaller scale, on Westminster Hall, the
oldest and largest part of the Palace of Westminster in London. This is one of the most
important English medieval buildings still extant, having been reconstructed by Richard
II between 1394 and 1399 from the building first constructed by William II in the eleventh
century. Points of similarity are the ground plan and the hammerbeam roof decorated
with the carved wooden figures of angels. Those to the left and right above the dais bear
scrolls inscribed *Scientia inflat*, *Charitas aedificat* (1 Cor. 8.1) and *Timor Domini*,
*Principium Sapientiae* (Prov. 9.10). The other ten figures carry books inscribed with symbols
referring to the arts and sciences over which they preside. Grammar has a papyrus roll,
dialectic has Aristotle's diagram of the three syllogistic figures, poetry has a harp, ethics
has St Mary's lily, metaphysics has a symbol of the deity, arithmetic has an abacus, geometry
has the forty-seventh proposition of the first book of Euclid, astronomy has a star, music
is credited with the design and painting of the roof decorations.

The stained glass windows consist of the Royal window in the northern wall (containing
a fine portrait of the young Queen Victoria), and the Oxford and Cambridge windows
of the west and east respectively, portraying the founders of the colleges of those universities.
The side windows contain portraits of people famous in English literature, history and
science.

Below the Oxford window is the eighteenth century Gobelin tapestry representing
Joseph and his brethren. The tapestry was a gift to the University by Sir Charles Nicholson,
Bt (1808-1903), a former Chancellor.

A pipe organ, built by Forster and Andrews of Hull, was installed in the Great Hall
during 1881-1882. It was replaced in 1971-72 by the present organ which was designed
by Rudolf von Beckerath of Hamburg and constructed and installed jointly by von
Beckerath and Mr R.W. Sharp of Sydney.
