A small group of us gathered at East Ocean for yumcha. East Ocean would have
been one of the restaurants that existed when we were studyingn at Sydney
University and some of us would have had yumcha there so this is yet another
trip down memory lane.

Despite arriving early (Hugh managed to get there around 11:15) we had to queue
as they will not allocate us a table until most of us have arrived. In the end,
we were allocated a private room which turned out to be good. There were no
shortage of dishes arriving to our table.

The selection of food on offer was surprisingly delicious and we had a good
time reminiscing as well as enjoying the food.

After lunch we walked to nearby Kurtosh for afternoon tea and coffe and
continued our conversation, which ranged from current projects we are working
on to favourite programming languages.
