We had our 35th graduation anniversary reunion on 25 May 2022 4pm. University of Sydney graciously booked two rooms for us (with the help of John McQueen who unfortunately couldn't attend).

- Madsen Building Tutorial Room 315 at 16:00-17:00
- Carslaw Seminar Room 350 at 17:00 – 19:00

Those that made it physically were Michael Barr-David, Rose Chay, Mark James, Chris Tham, Gary and Sing Guat Warner. Joining via Zoom was Hugh McGuiness, Beth Patterson, John Windle, Choon Yeoh (plus her husband Chip who made a special guest appearance).

It was really good to catch up with everyone and hear everyone’s stories and what they have been up for the past 35 years. We started at Madsen, then moved to Carslaw partway through and I was amazed the wifi connection (courtery of Gary and Sing Guat’s daughter who is studying at the uni) lasted across the journey.

We also managed to get some students to take photos of us around campus. These came out better than I expected, with minimal processing apart from noise reduction.

Afterwards we decided to have dinner in Chinatown, After some debate whether we should go Malaysian, Beijing or Shanghainese cuisine, we ended up at Emperor’s Garden which I remember we have been a few times for yum cha in the 80s plus also some late night/early morning dinners after a whole night working on our thesis. We were so hungry we half devoured the food before I remembered to take pictures.

We are thinking of getting together again in a few weeks time and try the Nanyang Club at Market City, but we will wait for Hugh to recover so he can join us.

There was also some talk about maybe visiting each other in different countries eg. US, New Zealand, Malaysia, Central Coast (yes, it is a foreign country) where some of us now reside.
