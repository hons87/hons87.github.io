I do actually have a website ([http://www.acquerra.com.au/personal/phoenix/](http://www.acquerra.com.au/personal/phoenix/)) hosted by my husband's website.

If you're interested in some of my photography there's some there but my most recent  blog post links to a book I recently created with the photos that have contributed towards me getting my PPSA qualification. Heavy on polar bears as judges seem to love them, but it gives a taste of some places I've been.
