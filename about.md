# About Us

## Computer Science in the 1980s

We enrolled at the University of Sydney in 1984 and studied Computer Science as
one of our subjects for a Bachelor of Science degree. Some of us enrolled in
double degrees (typically Science and Engineering). A number of us then
went on to do an honours year in 1987.

Maybe it was just the times, or the "vibe", or maybe there was something unique
about us, but we formed a strong bond as a group and did many things together.
For me at least, it was the most
enjoyable year of my university life.

Computer Science at that time was a nascent subject, more theoretical than the
way Software Engineering or Information Technology is taught today.

The Basser Department of Computer Science at the University of Sydney was
aligned to the Maths faculty rather than engineering, and the subjects we
learnt were more about the theory and philosophy of computing, and less about
the practical aspects of building software.

We studied the theory of computation, the provability and correctness of
algorithms, the
limits of what can or cannot be solved. We also learnt Computer Architecture,
operating systems, programming language theory and compiler construction,
and experimented with natural language processing and artificial
intelligence.

In hindsight, it was a unique and interesting time to study Computer Science,
because the computing industry was transitioning from mainframes and early
languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL and Algol, but this is before
concepts like design patterns, object orientation, model view controller and
languages such as C++ and Java. Python, Linux and HTML did not exist
yet. Undergraduates were taught Pascal in the first year, but many honours
students (such as myself) did our thesis projects in C and edited code in vi.

## Location

The Basser Department of Computer Science was located in the Madsen Building.
This is a gothic style building constructed in the 1940s, with a sandstone
façade and detailed sandstone moldings throughout. It was established as
Australia’s first National Standards Laboratory, and occupied by CSIRO before
ownership was transferred to the university in the 1970s.

There was a "secret" (actually, just not well known) way to access the top
of the clock tower, from which one can enjoy a bird's eye perspective of
the university campus and City Road.

||__Spoiler alert:__ there’s a cupboard in one
of the abandoned offices which opens up to a staircase which takes you up to a
protected castle-style roof.||

There was also a tunnel, built during World War II, that ran underneath Madsen
from Carslaw to the Physics building, that was frequented by students as an
underground walkway during bad weather. Sadly, it seems there is no way to
access this tunnel today.

As honours students, we had a common room available to us. Many of us
practically lived there (on sleeping beds), and for others it was a place to
stop by in between lectures.

The Madsen building currently is home to Geosciences and no longer associated
with Computer Science.

## Computing Environment

In the early to mid 1980s, the state of the art minicomputer was the ubiquitous
DEC VAX 11/780. The University of Sydney was an early adopter and significant
stakeholder in the UNIX Operating System, which was virtually unknown outside
of a few universities.

The computer used for teaching undergraduates was called 'basset' and ran
a highly customised version of UNIX/32V, modified to enable the VAX to
support hundreds of time-sharing interactive users.

As honours students, we had access to the research computer, called 'basser'
which was recently upgraded to the Eighth Edition Research Unix, and we
managed to have limited access to the Blit programmable bitmap graphics
terminal from Bell Labs.

The Basser Department of Computer Science maintained a strong relationship with 
Bell Labs and the founders of Unix, and we had visits from people such as Ken
Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and Rob Pike.

## Before the Internet there was ACSNET

The University of Sydney pioneered the interconnectivity of UNIX machines in Australia
through **ACSNET** - a loosely coupled network of heterogeneous machines. The
software for ACSNET was called 'The Sydney Unix Network' (SUN - not to be
confused with a hardware company that manufactured UNIX workstations) and
was written by Piers Dick Lauder and Bob Kummerfeld.

ACSNET was significantly easier to use than UUCP (which was commonly used in
other countries) as computers were reachable via domain names rather than
point to point routing.

The domain name for ACSNET was `.oz` so the `basser` VAX at the
Computing Science Department (`cs`) of Sydney University
(`su`) would be reachable via the fully qualified domain name of
`basser.cs.su.oz`.

For more information, refer to the following USENIX paper on ACSNET:
[ACSNET − The Australian Alternative to UUCP](http://ftp.fibranet.cat/UnixArchive/Applications/ACSnet/usenix_paper.pdf).

Australia was recognised as part of the Internet when the .au domain
was delegated to Robert Elz of ACSNET in March 1986. When Australia was fully
integrated into the Internet, the `.oz` ACSNET domain was moved under `.au` to
become `.oz.au`.
